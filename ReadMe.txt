Hello Chemist,

**This readme was last updated on 12/10/2020 along with the push of NMR_Overlay_v_1.0.2
	-Some information may be outdated

Use the github link (https://github.com/jpware2/NMR-Superposition-UP) for the most up-to-date releases. (exe not available)
Use the dropbox link (https://www.dropbox.com/sh/e9rsfpu365eev46/AABFjS7NihMQKhm1u2dSd99ga?dl=0) to acess the executable and .py file

If you have an installation of python, feel free to use the scripts in this folder for some extra features (split counting graphs, Hard Controlls, ect.)
	If you are missing any modules, import using [pip install "module"] the only weird one is tkinter, which uses [pip install Tk]
	Use the github link (https://github.com/jpware2/NMR-Superposition-UP) for the most up-to-date releases.

If you are using a windows machine without python, the NMR_Overlay_#.#.#.exe file is for you. 
	It will open a script. DON'T touch anything! After initiallization, it will ask you for a two file inputs. If you are using a Ligand / Complex data set, enter the ligand file path first. 
	The executable will not download anything unless you choose to save the graph.

If you have an apple computer, good luck...
	Maybe try running a virtual desktop or sell your macbook and get a real chemistry computer.

If you are running linux, I have no idea.
	But I'm sure you can figure it out if you made it this far.


Thanks for trusting my program. Find a way to contact me if you need help.
